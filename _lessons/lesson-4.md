## Overview

*Tools:* Socrata (city of Chicago open data portal version), Socrata Query Language (SoQL), Postman (a web browser-like tool for interacting with web APIs).

*Concepts:* Application programming interfaces (API), structured queries (select, filter, grouping, and aggregation), the request-response cycle.

*Philosophy:* Learning how to know what you need to learn next, how to understand enough to do what you need to do.

## Assignment

TBD. Will involve getting data from a Socrata web API, though.
